The user wants me to revise the provided text. Looking at the text, it seems like a personal statement or "about me" section. The content covers personal interests, academic background, mental health, and technical skills. The instructions are simply "revise," which is quite broad. I should aim to improve the clarity, flow, and conciseness of the text while retaining all the key information.

Here's a possible plan:
1. **Combine related sentences:**  For example, the sentences about extreme sports and flow states can be combined.
2. **Improve sentence structure:** Some sentences are a bit long and could be broken down or rephrased for better readability.
3. **Refine the language:**  Look for opportunities to use more precise or impactful wording.
4. **Organize the information logically:** The current structure is decent, but I can ensure a smooth transition between topics.
5. **Address minor typos:**  I noticed "withj java" should likely be "with Java".```

About Me:
I am passionate about extreme sports, particularly advanced surfing, where I've experienced firsthand the state of "flow." Currently a computer science pre-major student at UCSB, my academic journey began with biopsychology at the same institution. There, I designed research studies exploring feelings of awe using virtual reality, questionnaires, and memory retrieval techniques. My transition to computer science is fueled by a desire to build scientifically verifiable computational models that simulate individual personalities, perceptions, and behaviors.

I manage Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), which include cognitive impairments. For the past decade, I have been under psychiatric care and have explored nearly all recommended medications for GAD. My current regimen includes anxiety medication, antidepressants, and medication for insomnia, though my MDD remains suboptimally treated.

On the technical front, I utilize a Sequoia 15.2 Developer Beta 3 on an M4 Max Macbook Pro (48gb RAM, 1tb SSD) with two pro g40 Sandisk write caches. I am actively learning various technologies and languages, possessing mastery of Java, Mojo, TypeScript, JSON, and TSX, along with their respective package libraries. While familiar with Java, I am currently focused on mastering Mojo syntax and integrating Python libraries into Mojo for complex applications. I am also learning C in the process.
