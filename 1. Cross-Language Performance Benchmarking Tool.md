1. Cross-Language Performance Benchmarking Tool

Description:
Develop a benchmarking suite to compare the performance of identical algorithms implemented in Java, Mojo, and C. Focus on tasks such as numerical computations, data processing, and AI model inference.

Key Features:
	•	Algorithm Library: Implement a set of common algorithms (e.g., sorting, matrix multiplication).
	•	Performance Metrics: Measure execution time, memory usage, and CPU/GPU utilization.
	•	Reporting Interface: Generate comparative reports and visualizations.
	•	Extensibility: Allow users to add their own algorithms and test cases.

Technologies:
	•	Java: User interface and reporting tools.
	•	Mojo: AI model inference benchmarks.
	•	C: High-performance algorithm implementations.
